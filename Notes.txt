Angular Notes

Property Bindings:
	We use property binding with the square binding syntax 
	to bind properties of DOM objects to fields or properties 
	in our host component. That is the component that is 
	using the DOM object. In this case this image object, 
	another way to think of this is that this source property 
	is an input into this DOM object we use this to supply data 
	for this object, to supply some state.
	
	<img [src]="imageUrl" />
	
Event Bindings:
	we use event binding to respond to the events raised 
	from a DOM object. In this case, the click event of a button.
	
	<button (click)="onClick()"></button>
	

<favourite [isFavourite]="post.isFavourite" (change)="onFavouriteChange()"></favourite>
			<input property needed 			<output property needed 
			in favourite component>			in favorite component>
ERROR - can't bind the isFavorite since it isn't a known property of Favorite.

Reason - So this property binding doesn't work. Even though, in favorite 
		 component we have the field isFavorite and this is a public field. 
		 Because in Angular templates in order for you to use property 
		 binding, you need to define that property or that field as an 
		 input property
	
Solution - to add support for event binding and property binding, you need 
		   to define a special property in this favourite component that 
		   we refer to as an output and input property.
		
		   in order to make a component more reusable, we want to add a 
		   bunch of input and output properties. We use input properties 
		   to pass input or stay to a component. And we use output properties 
		   to raise events from these custom components. The combination of 
		   input and output properties for a component, make up for what 
		   we call the public API of that component
